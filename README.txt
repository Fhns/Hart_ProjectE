# 1) I completed steps 1-5 (Was told not to do 6 by classmate since I missed class when it was being explained to us) to the best of my capability, was having issues with ProjectC so it was very difficult to verify my work but I did still give it all my time and effort. I submitted both D and E for extra credit if possible.
# 2) These steps are verfiable to a certain extent with trying to launch the test OS, however some code may need to be  commented and uncommented out to test. Also there are some compiling issues sadly so I would compare to working code.
